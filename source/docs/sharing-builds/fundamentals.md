# Fundamentals

Working on multiple projects often implies **similar requirements** to their build implementation. A quick and easy solution, would be to copy the necessary files across all repositories. However, this can cause technical debt to grow over time. For instance, as soon as the unit testing is extended with a coverage tool, all these copies would need to be updated. Even worse, there is a high chance of ending up with divergent implementations when updating these copies becomes too time-consuming facing critical deadlines.

Naturally, builds written with NUKE are part of the repository and consists of pure C#. That allows to use two very pragmatic yet powerful approaches of maintaining builds in **separate submodules** or shipping **compiled assemblies via NuGet packages**. Furthermore, NUKE provides to additional techniques, namely **pre-build download of external files** and **builds as global tools**, which will be covered more thoroughly in the next sections.

For now, here is a short comparison between these solutions:

| Solution | Build Versioning | Build Extensibility | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Submodules | Yes, including branches | Difficult |
| NuGet Packages | Yes | Yes, via class inheritance |
| External Files | Yes, if supported by URL scheme | Yes, via partial declarations |
| Global Tools | Yes | No |
