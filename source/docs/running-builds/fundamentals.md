# Fundamentals

Depending on the operating system, one of the two bootstrapping scripts for PowerShell or BASH can be used to execute a build:

```powershell
$ ./build.sh [targets] [arguments]
$ ./build.ps1 [targets] [arguments]
```

> [!Hint]
> Executing a build triggers the creation of a directory `./tmp` for temporary files that should not be committed. It is recommended to create an VCS ignore entry.

### Arguments

Arguments can be passed either in **lisp-case or camel-case** style with either **single or double dash** as prefix. The preferred variant is lisp-case with two dashes, which is also used for the [global tool shell completion]():

```powershell
$ build --target pack --configuration release --api-key 12345
```

Certain parameters can accept **collections of values** that are separated with a _space_. The built-in parameters `--target` or `--skip` also allow the _plus sign_ for value separation:

```powershell
$ build --target test pack --skip clean+restore
```

### Help

A list of available targets, [predefined parameters](authoring-builds-predefined-parameters) as well as [custom declared parameters](authoring-builds-parameter-declaration) can always be shown by passing the `--help` switch:

### Summary

At the end of every build execution, a summary with statuses and elapsed time per each target is displayed. Also error and warning descriptions are repeatedly printed:

```powershell
No errors or warnings.
